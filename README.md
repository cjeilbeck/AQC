### AQC simulation

code that implements a simple AQC algorithm to solve a specified maximum set problem and print a graph of success probability with time. 

of no practical use itself as just a demonstration, but useful core functions are defined in the project files such as the Ising Hamiltonian and the evolution operator which may be of use for other projects.

to produce success probability graph clone repository and run the CORE file in python with required libraries: matplotlib, scipy, numpy.
